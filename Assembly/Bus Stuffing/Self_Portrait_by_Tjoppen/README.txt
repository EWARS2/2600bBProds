Self Portrait by Tjoppen
------------------------

A multi-color 18x75 fullscreen bitmap in 4 KiB on the Atari 2600 VCS.
Each line has a separate 2-bit palette.
Released at Revision 2012.
Source code included - feel free to play around with it :)
Fun things to do include creating an NTSC port.

Other VCS stuff by me
